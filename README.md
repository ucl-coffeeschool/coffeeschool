This is our project for Coding Curriculum. Our aim is to teach GCSE aged students how to program with JavaScript by creating a game through a number of lessons, culminating in making a flappy birds clone.

So far we have the interface and some begining lessons in the lessons folder, the interface that the students will use in the interface folder, and under flappySquare what we hope the students will achieve onece they've finished our course.
