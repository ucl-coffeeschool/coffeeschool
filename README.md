# Coffee School

Coffee School is a project to provide an introduction to JavaScript and give some exposure to game development in an interactive environment where the student can see the direct result of their code without having to install or run anything locally on their machine.

Once students are introduced to JavaScript in general, Coffee School gets students to produce a game similar to "Flappy Bird" through a series of lessons using a JavaScript framework called Craftyjs while trying to inform about programming and game development concepts and practices where relevant.
