Learn you a code Working Title
==============================

Our team is Alexis Enston, Matt Bell and Fraser Savage. We were inspired to create this because we wanted to show how easy programming in JavaScript was and how students can create interactive websites easily. Also we wanted to say that the sterotype of hackers in basements was not true, and that computer scientists come from a wide range of backgrounds and skills, and to convince people that Computer Science is a viable career option.

This is our project for Coding Curriculum. Our aim is to teach GCSE aged students how to program with JavaScript by creating a game through a number of lessons, culminating in making a flappy birds clone.

For the lessons the lessons the students will just need a web browser.

So far we have the interface and some begining lessons in the lessons folder, the interface that the students will use in the interface folder, and under flappySquare what we hope the students will achieve onece they've finished our course. We still need to complete all of the lessons, and smarten up the editor.
