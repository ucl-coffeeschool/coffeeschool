## Intro

This course is designed to teach you the basics of JavaScript (JS), which is the programming language which is most commonly used on the web to add interaction to HTML webpages. This course is based on learning coding, so lets jump in. 

In JavaScript we can do basic output via the console, by calling console.log(). *Try it now by writing `console.log("Hello World");`* and clicking Update. If you can now see Hello World in the console log on the right of the page, you have started your journey in JS! Be sure to remember the closing semicolon ; on each line.

## Variables

In JS you store data in variables, eg
`var hello = "Hello World!";
console.log(hello);`


We are using CraftyJS, which is a game framework for JavaScript, which means you can create games which will run on the web on any modern browser.
