# Welcome To Javascript!
_Time to complete: 5 minutes_

Hey there! Welcome to JavaScript. Let's get you straight up writing code. Programmers love to use "Hello world!" for some reason.

Therefore we shall do differently.

In the code editor, write "Hello, yourName!":

```javascript
    console.log('Hello world!');
```

Then press "update" to test the code and see your name appear in the console!
