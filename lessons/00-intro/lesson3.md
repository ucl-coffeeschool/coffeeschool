# Variables
_Time to complete: 5 minutes_

Being able to output the results of calculations or strings is great, but what if we want to store it and work with it? This is where variables come in. In JS, ```var``` lets you store any type of value, such as strings or numbers. Try it now:

```javascript
var myName = "Bob";
var myAge = 14;
myAge = myAge * 2;
console.log(myName);
console.log(myAge);
```

Remember to click 'update' once you're done!
