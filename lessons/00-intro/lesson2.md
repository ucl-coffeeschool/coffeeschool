##Goal: do some calculations

Now you've started, lets move on to actually making it calculate something. You can use the typical mathematical operations +,-,* and /. It also supports the mod operator, %, which gives you the remainder left after dividing a number, eg 17 % 5 = 2. JS also follows the rules of BODMAS, so make sure to remember this and use brackets if necessary. Try it now!

eg

```javascript
    console.log(10*3+6%4);
```

Now output 10*4+2 to complete the lesson.
