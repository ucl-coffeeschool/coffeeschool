Now you've started, lets move on to actually making it calculate something. You can use the typical mathematical operations +,-,* and /. JS also follows the rules of BODMAS, so make sure to remember this and use brackets if necessary. Try it now!

```javascript
    console.log(10*3+6);
```

Now output 10*4+2 to complete the lesson.
